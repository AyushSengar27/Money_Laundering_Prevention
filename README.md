# Predicting Fraud Transactions: A Machine Learning Approach

## Overview
The Money Laundering Prevention System is a sophisticated solution designed to detect and mitigate the risks associated with financial crimes, particularly money laundering. Money laundering involves the illegal process of disguising the origins of funds obtained through criminal activities to make them appear legitimate

## Project Highlights
- **Interactive User Interface:** Visualize predictions and insights through a user-friendly web interface.
- **Data-Driven Decisions:** Prevent money Laundering.
- **Technology Stack:** Utilizes Python 3.11, Streamlit, MongoDB, along with data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.11 installed on your system.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary Python packages.
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Launching the Application
1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Execute the following command to start the Streamlit application:
```sh
streamlit run app.py
```
3. Access the application locally at `http://localhost:8501/` or follow the on-screen instructions.
